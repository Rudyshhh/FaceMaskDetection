# FaceMaskDetection

I'd be glad to create a GitHub README for your face mask detection model:

**Face Mask Detection**

This repository implements a deep learning model for detecting face masks in both images and videos. It can be used for various applications, such as:

- **Real-time monitoring:** Monitor public spaces or workplaces to ensure compliance with mask-wearing regulations.
- **Data analysis:** Analyze footage to track mask usage trends over time.

**Features:**

- **Image and video support:** Detects masks in both static images and dynamic video streams.
- **Deep learning:** Leverages a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate and efficient detection.
- **Customization (Optional):** You can explore fine-tuning the model on your own dataset for potentially better performance (instructions provided).

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on your model implementation)
- Additional libraries may be required based on your specific implementation (e.g., NumPy, matplotlib)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/faceMaskDetection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**

1. **Image detection:**

   ```bash
   python detectImageTrial2.py 
   ```

2. **Video detection:**

   ```bash
   detectMaskVidOnline - Copy.ipynb 
   ```

**Customization (Optional):**

This section can be included if your model allows for fine-tuning:

1. Prepare your custom dataset of images labeled with "mask" and "no_mask" for each face.
2. Modify the training script (`train.py`) to use your custom dataset.
3. Train the model using the script.

**Disclaimer:**

This model is provided for educational and research purposes only. Accuracy may vary depending on the dataset and usage conditions. Use it responsibly and ethically.
